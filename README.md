# Enhancing the Reliability of Concrete Infrastructure through Explainable Machine Learning Insights into Rebar Corrosion

## Abstract

Rebar corrosion in reinforced concrete poses a critical threat to structural integrity and public safety, often causing costly and disruptive inspections. This study introduces an innovative predictive framework using three explainable machine learning models: CatBoost, Lasso regression, and a feature-selected variant of CatBoost. To enhance model reliability and reduce multicollinearity, it utilizes the minimum-redundancy
6maximum-relevance (mRMR) feature selection prior to model development. Model performance, assessed using standard regression metrics, yields R2 values of 0.67 (Lasso model), 0.96 (CatBoost with mRMR-features), and 0.98 (CatBoost with all features). The Jackknife+ method, applied to CatBoost model, generates prediction intervals with 93% coverage, enabling effective uncertainty quantification. Thorough feature importance analysis highlights that electrochemical indicators and mortar characteristics account for over 70% of CatBoostâ€™s predictive capacity. While CatBoost excels in accuracy and interpretability, the Lasso model offers a straightforward and transparent formulation with built-in feature selection via its regularization parameter (alpha). This integrated modeling approach empowers engineers to optimize maintenance schedules, select durable materials, and implement advanced monitoring systems, ultimately reducing corrosion-induced failures and extending the reliability and service life of reinforced concrete infrastructure.
